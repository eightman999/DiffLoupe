# DiffLoupe MacOS SwiftUI

This folder contains a minimal SwiftUI version of **DiffLoupe** for macOS.
The project is provided as a Swift Package that can be opened with Xcode.

## Build

On macOS with Xcode 15 or later:

1. Open the `Package.swift` in Xcode.
2. Build and run the `DiffLoupeSwiftUI` target.

This is only a basic skeleton demonstrating how a native SwiftUI version
could be started. Features from the C++/Qt and Python versions are not yet implemented.
